# The Central Seed Cooperative "COSEM" 




## Presentation

Central Seed Cooperative COSEM was created in July 1947 and is regarded as oldest in seed multiplication and production (Bulletin économique de la Tunisie N° 55 année 1951). COSEM's purpose is to produce, multiply, store, condition, process and market seeds: Varietal conservation (G0,G1,G2,G3) Seed propagation and production (G4, SC1,SC2) Marketing of certified seed. 

Its goal is the supply of its members with all the products and resources necessary for their activities at the best price, on time and of the highest quality. 

Most of the COSEM seed multipliers are among the most important grain producers in the country, and some of them are the founders of the co-op. 
COSEM's technicians are highly skilled.  

To carry out its activities, COSEM relies on three factors: means of production, human capital and financial capital. 


*   Production facilities 
*   Human capital 

### Production facilities

1. Seed conditioning station in MANOUBA, with a surface area of 5,176 m2 and two lines: 
      * The first line, acquired in 1955, has a capacity of 6 tons/hour and is installed under concrete storage cells (with a capacity of 40,000 QX). 
      * The second line, acquired in 1984, has a theoretical capacity of 10 tonnes per hour but only produces 5 tonnes per hour due to lack of space. 

2. A new cereal seed conditioning station with a total capacity of 10 tons/hour, installed in 2018 at Tbourba.

3. Five warehouses with a surface area of 2873 m2, located on land leased from the SNCFT. They house a legume packaging line acquired in 1980 and in relatively good condition, as well as the storage of legumes and bags.  

### Human capital 

COSEM has a total of 47 statutory employees who work in the various production centres and at the head office. 
To meet its collection needs, the cooperative uses casual labour, hiring an average of 100 workers depending on the size of the cereal harvest. 

## Cereal seed production processes and itinerary

COSEM covers 11,000 hectares in the 10 northern governorates (10,000 hectares for grain and 1,000 hectares for leguminous and forage crops). The number of seed multipliers involved in COSEM is 100, of which 80 are members. The total of species and varieties produced is 13 species and 26 varieties. 

The quantity of seed produced per species (average over the last few years) is equal to: 

*   Durum wheat: 215,000 qx (91.5%) 
*   Common wheat: 8,000 qx (3.5%) 
*   Barley: 7,000 qx (3%) 
*   Oats: 3,000 qx (1.2%) 
*   Pulses (all species): 2,000 qx (0.8%)

Certified seed: 90% is marketed through the Cereals Board. 
Pre-basic and basic seed: 10% is intended for the production of certified seed through multiplication contracts. 

The various categories of seed are the subject of an ASM credit granted by the Cereals Office to COSEM from the BNA for the purchase of raw seed (financing agreement between the Cereals Office and COSEM).
